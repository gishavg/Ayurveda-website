    <p>The word Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word that evolves from combination of two 
    words, "Ayuh" meaning life and "veda" meaning knowledge. Ayurveda "Science 
    of Life" or "wisdom of life" deals with nature and includes all aspects of 
    life. Ayurveda is a 6000year old science that originated in India and the 
    components and concept of Ayurveda is rooted in Vedas, the ancient book of 
    knowledge that dates around 3000BC. The component of the science that deals 
    with health and disease is known as Ayurvedic Medicine and came into 
    existence around 1000BC.</p><p>Ayurvedic Medicine is the world's oldest 
    comprehensive health care system and is indigenous to India where it is 
    widely practiced. "This ancient art of healing asserts that the science, 
    philosophy and spirituality are all necessary aspects of healthy living." 
    Thus Ayurveda is not only a comprehensive medical system but also a way of 
    living and the very concept of "mind, body and spirit" originates from 
    Ayurveda.</p><p>It is now one of the most recognized and widely practiced 
    disciplines of alternative medicine in the world. Some of the popular 
    practices of Ayurveda are Meditation, Yoga, chanting, breathing exercises, 
    Panchakarma and Herbs. For more information please visit
    <a href="http://www.ayurvedahealth.org/">www.ayurvedahealth.org</a>.</p><p>
    Ayurveda is recognized by The National Health Institutes/Center for 
    Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NIH)/ NCCAM) as an Alternative 
    Medicine, a complete medical system, website <a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/">

	Definition of Health</span></p>
	<p><em>Adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO)</em></p>
	<p>Sam dosha, samagni, samdhatu malakriyah<br>
	Prasannatma, indriyas manah swath abhidayate.<br>
	–
	Sushruta stru 24/41</p>
	<p>Health is in balance when all three doshas (bioenergy) and agni 
	(metabolic process) are in balance, and excretions are in proper order. When 
	atman (soul), senses, manah (intellect) are in harmony with internal peace, 
	the svastha (optimal health) is achieved.</p>
	<p><strong>Ayurvedic Classics:</strong> Are written in Sanskrit and are a 
	major source of information.</p>
	<p><span class="greentitles">Major Ayurvedic Classics (Brhattrayi)</span></p>
	<p><strong>Charak Samhita by Charaka </strong><br>
	Charak Samhita, which dates back to approximately 800 BCE, is a major 
	compendium of Ayurvedic medical theory and practice that Charaka, an 
	internist at the University of Taxila, compiled in Sanskrit. Presented as 
	poetry, Samhita contains more than 8,400 verses in its 120 chapters. Modern 
	Ayurvedic physicians still use Samhita in their medical training, and the 
	text has been widely translated. The most widely recommended translation is 
	one by Dr. P.V. Sharma, which contains extensive appendices and a rich 
	index.</p>
	<p><strong>Sushruta Samhita by Sushruta </strong><br>
	This surgical text, which dates back to approximately 700 BCE, contains 
	seminal content such as the Ayurvedic definition of health, information on 
	blood, and the description of five sub-doshas of Pitta and the marma points. 
	This volume also includes pioneering techniques in skin grafting and 
	reconstructive surgery.</p>
	<p><strong>Ashtanga Sangraha and Ashtanga Hridaya by Vagbhata</strong><br>
	Ashtanga Sangraha and Ashtanga Hridayam, dating back to approximately 400 
	CE, were written by an Ayurvedic physician from the Sindh region of India. 
	The Sangraha is primarily written in poetry, while The Hridayam is presented 
	as prose. These texts define the five subdoshas of Kapha and emphasize the 
	material value of life. The Hridaya is still highly regarded as a primary 
	Ayurvedic medical textbook; Srikantha Murthy's translation is recommended 
	for English readers.</p>
	<p><span class="greentitles">Minor Ayurvedic Classics (Lghutrayi)</span></p>
	<p><strong>Sarangadhar Samhita by Sharngadhara </strong><br>
	This text was written in the 13th century CE, and is valued for its 
	explanation of the Ayurvedic concept of materia medica, as well as for its 
	pharmacological formulations. It is also considered the foremost text on 
	pulse diagnosis.</p>
	<p><strong>Bhav Prakash Nighantu by Bhavamisra</strong><br>
	This 16th century text contains approximately 10,278 verses of varying 
	meters and focuses on herbal descriptions, food, the therapeutic use of 
	trace metals, and rejuvenation therapies. Information on sexually 
	transmitted diseases, particularly syphilis, is also included.</p>
	<p><strong>Madhava Nidan by Madhava Kara</strong><br>
	This text was written between 700 CE and 1100 CE, and is valued for its 
	precise classification of diseases and disease etiology, particularly in the 
	fields of pediatrics and toxicology. Madhava Nidan is considered the Bible 
	for Ayurvedic clinical diagnosis.</p>
	<p><span class="greentitles">Ayurvedic Approach to Health and Wellness</span></p>
	<p>To maintain the health of a healthy person and cure the disease of a 
	diseased.</p>
	<p><strong>Preventive Medicine</strong> – Creates and maintains health 
and 
	longevity of an individual by maintaining balance of a person's 
prakturi (or constitution) by creating daily and periodic regimens. 
These 
	health routines focus on diet and exercise, herbals, massage, 
meditation, 
	and social behavior and positive relationships.</p>
	<p><strong>Curative Medicine</strong> – Treatments to cure the disease by 
	one or combination of the following approaches:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Internal measures, including shodhana (detoxification) and shamana 
		(methods used to improve quality of life via palliative care).</li>
		<li>External measures, including snehana (oil treatments), svedana 
		(steam therapy using herbal steam), and use of herbal pastes.</li>
		<li>Surgical methods, including removal of tissues, organs, and harmful 
		growths.</li>
		<li>Mental and spiritual therapies or daivya chikitsa.</li>
		<li>Herbal therapy, including astute pharmacology.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><span class="greentitles">Ayurvedic Specialties</span></p>
	<p>Ayurvedic medicine features the following eight specialty branches. These 
	trainings are achieved at accredited Ayurvedic medical Schools.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Internal Medicine (Kaya-Chikitsa), which focuses on doshic 
		imbalance, metabolic function, and digestion.</li>
		<li>Surgery (Shalya Chikitsa).</li>
		<li>Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat (Salakya Chikitsa).</li>
		<li>Obstetrics/Gynecology (Prasuti and Stri-Rog).</li>
		<li>Pediatrics (Bala Chikitsa/ Kaumarbhritya).</li>
		<li>Psychology and Psychiatry (Bhuta-vidya or Graha-Chikitsa), which 
		includes spirituality.</li>
		<li>Toxicology (Agadha-tantra), which focuses on poisons ranging from 
		insect bites to heavy metals and plants, and includes a medical 
		jurisprudence role in which practitioners address cause of injury, 
		death, and other medical ethics.</li>
		<li>Rejuvenation/Geriatrics (Rasayana) and Virilification/Sexology (Vajikaran).</li>
	</ul>
	<p><span class="greentitles">Safety and Efficacy of Ayurvedic Medicine</span></p>
	<p>Ayurvedic Medicine is recognized by the WHO 
	and is used safely by millions of people. However, like any other medical 
	system, Ayurvedic therapies have contraindications and potential for adverse 
	effects or side effects. This is of particular concern when therapies are 
	prescribed by unqualified practitioners, are not used correctly and are 
	abused by self prescription. Ayurveda does not propagate that herbs are 
	safe. Panchakarma (detoxication) should be performed only by qualified 
	Ayurvedic practitioners who are trained in this sub-specialty.</p>
	<p>Consumers must bear responsibility when seeking Ayurvedic therapies to 
	check the credentials, training, and experience of the practitioners. 
	Consumers must also communicate, with their conventional and Ayurvedic 
	practitioners and practice full disclosure about the therapies they are 
	using.</p>
	<p>It is important to note that the United States Food and Drug 
	Administration does not regulate herbs or dietary supplements.
	<a href="http://www.ayurvedahealth.org/">The International Society for 
	Ayurveda and Health</a> (ISAH), a professional society of Ayurveda in the 
	United States, recommends Ayurvedic therapeutic herbal use or detoxification 
	only when prescribed, administered and properly supervised by a trained 
	practitioner.</p>
	<p>When seeking Ayurvedic practitioner, ISAH recommends partnering with a 
	practitioner who holds a doctoral degree (e.g., M.D., Ph.D., or Phys.D.) and 
	has completed training at a recognized Ayurvedic medical school.</p>
